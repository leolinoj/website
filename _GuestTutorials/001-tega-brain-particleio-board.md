My first guest is Tega Brain. Tega is an Australian artist, teacher and engineer who gives us a tutorial on environmental sensing and p5.js. In this video, she shows you how to set up a light sensor with a wireless physical computing platform called Particle. She teaches you how to read the data in p5js and make a basic data visualization.
