The Coding Train is thrilled to welcome Suz Hinton (aka noopkat)! Suz shows how to get started with hardware using JavaScript, an Arduino Uno board, an OLED screen and the Johnny-Five library.

Suz Hinton is a web developer who also loves working with electronics as a hobby. She maintains open source hardware libraries on Github, and live streams her coding activities weekly on Sundays.
