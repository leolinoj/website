In this video, I outline what you need setup and ready before you begin the course Working with Data and APIs in JavaScript.

What you need to know:
- JavaScript
- HTML basics
- Basics of CSS (useful but not required)

Materials/Programs:
- Code editor (I use Visual Studio Code but other examples are included below)
- Shell access to your computer (we go over this in Module 2)
