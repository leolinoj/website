We are now in Module #2! In our previous module, we focused on client-side Javascript. We now will learn the basics of server-side programming with Node.

2.1 We will begin building the Data Selfie App, a project tutorial by Joey K. Lee. This unit we will spend time getting setup with Node.js and our workflow.
