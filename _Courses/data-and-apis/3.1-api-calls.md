Welcome to Module 3! I covered a lot about node.js in the previous module, but there are still a few key elements left to discuss!

In this module, I build the "Weather Here" project (based on example by Joey Lee). In this first video, I demonstrate how to connect to an external API from node.js itself. Later, I'll look at how to hide an API key as well as deploy a project to publicly accessible web server..
